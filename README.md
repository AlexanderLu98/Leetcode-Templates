# Leetcode Templates

## Overview
This repository contains templates for common algorithms and data structures used in Leetcode problems. The goal is to provide a starting point for solving problems efficiently.

## Completed Templates
### Linked List
- Reverse
- Floyd's Cycle Detection
  - Find middle
  - Cycle detection
  - Find the first element of the cycle
- Merge

### Sliding Window (Possibly redundant as they are more used as concepts in nature)
- Fixed size
- Variable size

### Trees
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Preorder traversal
- Inorder traversal
- Postorder traversal
- Level-order traversal
- ZigZag-order traversal
- Reverse Level-order traversal
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)

## In Progress
- Binary Search

## TODO
### High Priority
- Backtracking
- Graphs
- Heap/Priority Queue

### Medium Priority
- Greedy Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming (DP)
  - 1D DP
  - 2D DP
  - Multi-dimensional DP
- Divide and Conquer
- Sorting algorithms
- Hashing
- Two Pointers (Possibly redundant as they are more used as concepts in nature)
    - From opposite direction
    - From same direction
- Stack
- Queue
- Array

### Low Priority
- Tries
- Bit manipulation
- Union Find

## Future Plans
- Create duplicates of templates with more comments and explanations for better understanding.
